# utd-cs-assignments
This is a repository of assignments I completed for my various CS classes at UTD. This is mostly for my personal usage to refer back to things I did in the past in case I need them again.

I wouldn't recommend using my answers for your assignments.

- CS2336: Computer Science 2, C++
- CS3340: Computer Architecture, MIPS Assembly
- CS3345: Data Structures and Algorithms, Java
